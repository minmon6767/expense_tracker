# expense_tracker
A super simple, beginner-friendly Python script to keep track of your daily spending.  I wrote this to practice the basics of Python—like file handling, loops, and user input—without using any complicated imports or extra tools. It just uses standard Python logic!
## Features
* Add a new expense (Category and Amount).
* View all past expenses.
* Calculate the total sum of money spent.
* Saves data to a text file so it isn't lost.

## How to Run
1. Open the folder in the terminal or command prompt.
2. Type `expense-tracker.py` and press Enter.
3. Follow the menu options.
